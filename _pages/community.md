title: The Asellus research community
---

We are a small, but growing communitx - for instance, on November 26th 2021, the 2nd Asellus Symposium was held online and there were some 40+ registered participants from institutions in 14 countries. People use  _Asellus _ for various reasons - e.g., to investigate selective forces and determinants of pigmentation, intraspecific variation in innovativeness and behavioural responses to predator cues, foraging ecology and life-history variation, and species interactions (host-parasite, host-microbiome, predator-prey) to phylogeography and microevolution. 


## Let's connect!

We have set up two google groups to communicate with each other as a larger group ([see how this works here](https://uit.stanford.edu/service/gsuite/groups/mailinglists/list-faqs)):

1. There is one group to send or receive the latest _Asellus_ related news. Simply sign up here and adjust your subscription settings - everything except "No email" will work:  **[ https://groups.google.com/g/asellus-mail](https://groups.google.com/g/asellus-mail)** Note that after signing up you cannot post to the group online, but only send messages to everyone by sending an email to the group address (asellus-mail@googlegroups.com).

2. There is a second group that is intended as a forum for questions or extended scientifuc exchange on _Asellus_ related topics and questions: **[https://groups.google.com/g/asellus-forum](https://groups.google.com/g/asellus-forum)** The idea for this one is to engange in discussions within posts and threads, so you can also chose to reduce the number of emails you receive, .e.g., to daily digests.

Note that we have come up with this two-group scheme to reduce the amount of emails that circulate, so please only use the email list to communicate important messages to everyone and the forum for more extended discussions and exchange.

## Community topology

The current landscape of _Asellus aquaticus_ research, based on data from Lafuente et al. (2021), where a literature survey was conducted on ~ 1600 papers on or including _A. aquaticus_ up until 2021. All corresponding authors and the clusters of research groups and interactions they form are visualized here using [VOSviewer](https://www.vosviewer.com/):
