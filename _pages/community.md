title: The Asellus research community
---

On November 26th 2021, the 2nd Asellus Symposium was held online and there were some 40+ registered participants from institutions in 14 countries. _Asellus_ isopods are studied for various reasons - e.g., to investigate selective forces and determinants of pigmentation, intraspecific variation in innovativeness and behavioural responses to predator cues, foraging ecology and life-history variation, and species interactions (host-parasite, host-microbiome, predator-prey) to phylogeography and microevolution. 

## Ways to connect

We have set up a google group that works as a mailing list to send or receive the latest _Asellus_ related news: [https://groups.google.com/g/asellus-mail](https://groups.google.com/g/asellus-mail) After signing up you can adjust your subscription settings - everything except "No email" will work. Now you can send messages to everyone by sending an email to the group address (asellus-mail@googlegroups.com) or by posting something online. 

There is also a [facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/331084148514453) and a [twitter account](https://twitter.com/theasellus). 

If you have data or materials to contribute, if have questions about this initiative, or would like to contribute by joining the consortium, please contact us: [asellus.consortium@gmail.com](mailto:asellus.consortium@gmail.com). We organize ourselves via a slack-channel and through monthly virtual meetings - everyone is welcome to join!


## Community topology

The current landscape of _Asellus aquaticus_ research, based on data from Lafuente et al. (2021), where a literature survey was conducted on ~ 1600 papers on or including _A. aquaticus_ up until 2021. All corresponding authors and the clusters of research groups and interactions they form are visualized here using [VOSviewer](https://www.vosviewer.com/):
