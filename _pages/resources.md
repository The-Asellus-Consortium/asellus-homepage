Here we collect links to protocols (e.g., for maintenance or phenotyping) and datasets (e.g., images or genomes). We don't host any data ourselves, but rather point to external open science data platforms.  

## Protocols 

### Written manuals

[No. 1 - Food pellets](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1whR5raKn40YuP9GanZAj118Z-thcOPFAc2KezJrZREk/edit?usp=sharing) - make tasty (or not) standardized food pellets for isopods

[No. 2 - Sex determination](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1whR5raKn40YuP9GanZAj118Z-thcOPFAc2KezJrZREk/edit?usp=sharing) - make tasty (or not) standardized food pellets for isopods

Planned: Maintenace, phenotyping, staging of embryos, ... ?

## Data

### Images

We have implemented a [Dataverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dataverse), an open science storage solution where where groups or organizations can store their data that might be relevant to others. [...]

The dataverse **asellus_images** can be found here: [https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/asellus_images/](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/asellus_images/).

### Molecular resources

Will be added in the future - if you have ideas for hosting platforms (genbank, ENA, etc.), please get in touch!
