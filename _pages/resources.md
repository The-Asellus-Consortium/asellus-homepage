About data sources for asellus

## Images

We have implemented a [Dataverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dataverse), an open science storage solution where where groups or organizations can store their data that might be relevant to others. [...]

The dataverse **asellus_images** can be found here: [https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/asellus_images/](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataverse/asellus_images/).
