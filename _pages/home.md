## Welcome!

This the homepage of **The Asellus Consortium** - an interest group for the broad use of _Asellus aquaticus_ as a system to study ecological, evolutionary and developmental phenomena. The purpose of this website is to connect people interested in or already working with _A. aquaticus_ and to provide links to data repositories and protocols. 

We are currently still in the phase of consolidating knowledge, connecting interest-groups, and exploring ways to move this initiative forward. At the same time, we are slowly building content for this website, and we hope we can count on your contributions
